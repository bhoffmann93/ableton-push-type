# ableton-push-type

An early prototype of an interface for modular design. Originally a MIDI controller for Ableton, Push is reimagined as a tactile design device where users cycle through modules to create illustrations, icons, and letterforms. Using both hands, it explores design beyond mouse and keyboard.

The tool runs on a custom grid algorithm using shaping functions and is built with p5js HTML Canvas and the WebMIDI API.
